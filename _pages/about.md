Hello, and welcome!

I'm a recent PhD graduate from the University of Glasgow. I have worked on multi-messenger astronomy with kilonovae, gravitational wave cosmology and detector calibration as part of the LIGO collaboration.

When I'm not doing research, I enjoy getting involved in various outreach activities! I'm also a hobby artist and have made a lot of art inspired by my work.
