Hello, and welcome!

I'm a PhD student at the University of Glasgow, working mainly on multi-messenger astronomy with a focus on EM follow-up and parameter estimation from kilonovae. I have worked on cosmology using gravitational waves in the past, and hope to get back to it! I also work on the calibration of the aLIGO detectors. I'm also very involved in outreach activities, and a hobbyist artist. This page is currently under construction, and therefore pretty empty still. In the meantime, feel free to browse my science-inspired art gallery!
